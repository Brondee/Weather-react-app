## About
In the app you can search for your city by its name. Using the [OpenWeather api](https://openweathermap.org/api) info about current weather and daily forecast will be 
displayed directly in the app. If a city's name was incorrect or api didn't find any info about that city, modal will be displayed with error message, also the input
will be with a red border.
## Setup
At first you should go to [OpenWeather api website](https://openweathermap.org/api) and get the api key, you will receive it after registration.<br>
After that run 
```
npm install && npm start
```
